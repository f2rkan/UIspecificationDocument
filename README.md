User Management Screen UI Specification

Introduction

This document outlines the user interface (UI) specification for the User Management screen. The purpose of this screen is to allow administrators to manage the users of the system. The UI should be easy to use and navigate, and provide all the necessary functionality for the administrator to manage users.

Requirements

The UI should provide a way to view, create, edit, and delete user accounts.
The UI should provide a way to search for users by name or email address.
The UI should provide a way to sort users by name, email, or date created.
The UI should provide a way to filter users by role (e.g. admin, editor, viewer).
The UI should provide feedback to the user when actions are successful or unsuccessful.

UI Components

The User Management screen should include the following UI components:

A search bar to allow users to search for specific users by name or email address.
A button to add a new user.
A table to display all users, with columns for name, email, role, and date created.
Buttons to edit and delete individual users.
A dropdown menu to allow users to filter by role.
Buttons to sort the table by name, email, or date created.


User Flow

When the User Management screen is first opened, the table should display all users sorted by name.
The search bar should allow users to enter text to search for specific users by name or email address. The table should be updated in real-time as the user types.
Clicking the "Add User" button should open a modal window where the administrator can enter the new user's information, including name, email, password, and role.
Clicking the "Edit" button for a specific user should open a modal window where the administrator can edit the user's information.
Clicking the "Delete" button for a specific user should prompt the administrator to confirm the deletion before proceeding.
The dropdown menu should allow the administrator to filter the table by role. The table should be updated in real-time as the administrator selects a different role.
Clicking the buttons to sort the table should sort the table by the selected column in ascending or descending order.

Conclusion

The User Management screen should provide all necessary functionality for administrators to manage users, with a clear and intuitive UI. The UI components and user flow described in this document should be followed by software developers when implementing the User Management screen.
